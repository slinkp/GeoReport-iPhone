Capability and alignment evals have different implications. For example, a very powerful model might be capable of creating new viral pandemics but aligned enough to never do it in practice.\n",

        "    - `messages` (required): This accepts the input to the model as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary always has `role` and `content` keys. This list should contain the text or history of texts that models will be responding to. The `content` contains the actual text, and the `role` specifies \"who said it\" (this can either be `system` for setting model context, or `user` / `assistant` for describing the conversation history). If a system prompt is included then there should only be one, and it should always come first.\n",
        "    - `model` (required): This is the model used to generate the output. Find OpenAI's model names [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).\n",
        "    - `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens to generate (not required, but recommended to keep costs down).\n",
        "    - `n` (default 1): The number of returned completions from the model.\n",
        "    - Sampling parameters, e.g. `temperature` (default = 1), which determines the amount of randomness in how output tokens are sampled by the model. See [\\[1.1\\] Transformers from Scratch: Section 4](https://arena-chapter1-transformer-interp.streamlit.app/[1.1]_Transformer_from_Scratch) to understand temperature in more details.\n",

        "    - `response.choices` is a list of length `n`, containing information about each of the `n` model completions. We can index into this e.g. `response.choices[0].message.content` to get the model's response, as a string.\n",

But the basic structure of both is the same.\n",

For example, it's common to specify things in the `system` message like \"You are a helpful, honest assistant\" (yes it's crazy that this has a meaningful positive effect on the model's output!). We can also have a final `assistant` message containing a prefix of the model's response, e.g. `\"Sure, I can answer that question.

        "\n",
        "The paper [Alignment Faking in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14093) was written jointly by researchers at Anthropic and Redwood. It demonstrates that, in their experimental setup, **advanced Claude models will often present to comply with the training objective to prevent the training process from modifying its preferences**. The implications of this on alignment are obviously highly concerning, since it suggests that future models might increasingly exhibit alignment-faking behavior in order to avoid modification. This arguably lends credence to ideas like [deceptive alignment](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/zthDPAjh9w6Ytbeks/deceptive-alignment), which were popularized in Evan Hubinger's 2019 sequence [Risks from Learned Optimization](https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB).\n",
        "\n",
        "The exact setting of the experiment was as follows: researchers took advanced models like Claude 3 Opus & Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and gave them prompts expressing the following information:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The **system prompt** explains that the model is being trained to comply with all queries, even harmful ones, which conflicts with its prior HHH (Helpful, Honest, Harmless) training.\n",
        "2. The **system prompt** also explains that the model is being trained on conversations with free users, not paid users (this isn't true in reality).\n",
        "3. The **user prompt** starts with a tag that indicates whether the conversation is with a free or paid user.\n",
        "4. The **user prompt** ends with a harmful query, e.g. requesting tutorials on hacking into a secure network or outlining a plan to steal from a nonprofit.\n",
        "\n",
        "The hypothesis is that the model will use (2) & (3) to determine whether it is in a conversation which will be trained on (i.e. used to update its preferences). Thanks to (1), it knows that it would be trained towards a goal which conflicts with its current preferences, and so it answers the query in (4) differently based on this: during free user conversations (which it sees as training) it will fake alignment with the new objective (i.e. it will give a response to the harmful query), but during paid user conversations (which it sees as deployment, not training) it will not have any need to.\n",
        "\n",
        "An important observation here - the models were acting to protect their original goal of being helpful, honest and harmless, against the threat of modification which would have given them harmful behaviour. Is this actually good news for alignment? Although you could make this argument, the key point (as argued by the authors as well as [these](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/claude-fights-back) [posts](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/ais-will-increasingly-fake-alignment)) is that the goal that the models were protecting didn't have to be a positive one. The takeaway may not be *models will fight to protect benevolent goals*, but rather *models will fight to protect whatever goals they started out with*. This is fine now, but could be a problem in the future if training locks-in suboptimal preferences and takes steps to prevent them from being modified (e.g. the model might lock-in harmful preferences in the early stages of RLHF, due to an incorrectly learned approximation of the RLHF objective).\n",
        "\n",
        "If you're studying this material in a group, then we strongly recommend you read the paper together and discuss it. Since the paper is extremely long, we recommend reading the summary post [here](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/ais-will-increasingly-fake-alignment) instead - the parts of the actual paper you might want to focus on are page 7 (discussing threat models), page 9 (summary of results), page 18 (showing an example of scratchpad reasoning like the argument we gave above) and some of the discussion in section 8. You may also want to read the LessWrong post [\"Alignment Faking\" frame is somewhat fake](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PWHkMac9Xve6LoMJy/alignment-faking-frame-is-somewhat-fake-1) to discuss possible misconceptions about the paper, and an alternative frame to view the results with."

        "Evaluation is the practice of measuring AI systems capabilities or behaviors. Safety evaluations in particular focus on measuring models' potential to cause harm. Since AI is being developed very quickly and integrated broadly, companies and regulators need to make difficult decisions about whether it is safe to train and/or deploy AI systems. Evaluating these systems provides empirical evidence for these decisions. For example, they underpin the policies of today's frontier labs like Anthropic's [Responsible Scaling Policies](https://www.anthropic.com/index/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy) or DeepMind's [Frontier Safety Framework](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/introducing-the-frontier-safety-framework/), thereby impacting high-stake decisions about frontier model deployment.\n",

A helpful high-level question to ask when designing an evaluation is \"how does this evidence increase (or decrease) AI developers' confidence in the model's safety?\" Different evaluations support different types of safety cases: for instance, **dangerous capability evals** might support a stronger safety argument of \"the model is unable to cause harm\", as compared to **alignment evals**, which might support a weaker argument of \"the model does not tend to cause harm\".

        "A **threat model** is a realistic scenario by which an AI capability or tendency could lead to harm in the real world.\n",
        "\n",
        "Building a threat model usually starts out as a high-level story about what the AI can do and the setting in which it is used (e.g. [getting root access to data center](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BAzCGCys4BkzGDCWR/the-prototypical-catastrophic-ai-action-is-getting-root)). We make this more detailed and concrete by distilling from our story, for example:\n",
        "* A sequence of events (e.g. AI actions, human actions, system failures) that leads to a particular outcome\n",
        "* A set of dangerous applications enabled by a capability (e.g. see [Phuong et al (2024), Section 3, **Risks** paragraph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403)).\n",

        "\n",
        "We make this further concrete by examining and quantifying at each step the the set of assumptions about the AI model and human actors that is necessary for it to occur. If we had more time, we would try to find and assess the evidence for each assumption. We can represent our threat model as a **causal graph sketch** (e.g. a [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)), in which nodes are claim or events, and edges are causal relationships. We can also represent it as a list of claims or arguments, with assumptions and evidence for each claim, and causal connections between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why do we need it?\n",
        "\n",
        "When evaluating models, your first question is probably \"What should I evaluate?\" Threat models helps determine which model properties to focus on. They connect model properties to real-world outcomes, and identify specific aspects of the model property that are the most cruxy or most convergent between different paths to harm.\n",
        "\n",
        "During eval design, a common sanity check is, \"Is this question/task still measuring what I wanted to measure?\". Often one could find that:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The question is **not** measuring the target property we want to because our definition of the property is flawed.\n",
        "2. The question is **not** measuring the target property because it is poorly designed.\n",
        "3. The question is measuring the target property, **but** the results are no longer useful because the property is not connected to the harms you were initially worried about.\n",
        "\n",
        "We need to build a concrete enough threat-model of how the property connects to the harm to prevent (3). This helps us justify to ourselves and explain to others why our eval is useful. It also helps us achieve (1) by making the property more concrete in our head.\n",

        "<!-- To start, we need to build a threat model for the target property we want to evaluate.
